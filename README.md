This is a project for the ALC 2.0 Take a Climb Challenge. The Andela Learning Community program is a collaborative effort of [Andela](https://andela.com), [Google](https://twitter.com/googleafrica), and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). This application's features are implemented using native JavaScrip, and it helps to save and keep track of various contacts, their numbers, emails, and, optionally, their images. However, the application does not persist data in any way, so, the app's implementation is focused on frontend
